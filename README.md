# project1
From the Flutter-Firebase tutorials, with some modifications for the Alan app

## Important Things That Need to be Noted

I haven't modified the full class structure for the users to fit the app yet

The register screen doesn't actually do anything with the information in the last name and username fields, t1he auth works only with email

The home screen of the app has not been modified
